# Python Practice & Mini Projects

Welcome to my **Python Practice & Mini Projects** repository!
This space is where I document my journey in Python—from mastering basics through practice questions to building simple projects. I’ll keep updating it regularly as I explore new topics and challenges.

> 📌 *The `Practice Questions` folder will keep growing as I continue learning new concepts and revising existing ones.*

## 🧠 Practice Questions

This section focuses on the core building blocks of Python. Each sub-topic contains beginner-level exercises, helping me reinforce my understanding of:

* Data Types & Variables
* Conditional Logic
* Strings, Lists, Tuples, Dictionaries, and Sets
* Looping & Functions
* Number Problems (Armstrong, Palindrome, Fibonacci, etc.)

## 🚀 Mini Projects

These are basic mini-projects that I created to apply my foundational Python skills in a fun way. More projects will be added as I progress 🚧

* `digitalclock.py` — Live digital clock with GUI
* `tictactoe.py` — Simple 2-player console game
* `snake_eater_gun.py` — Classic "Snake Water Gun" terminal game

> 🛠️ *These are just the beginning! More creative and advanced mini-projects coming soon.*
