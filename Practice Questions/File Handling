#pg1: Write a program to read the text from a given file â€˜poems.txtâ€™ and find out 
whether it contains the word â€˜twinkleâ€™.

#pg12:
The game() function in a program lets a user play a game and returns the score 
as an integer. You need to read a file â€˜Hi-score.txtâ€™ which is either blank or 
contains the previous Hi-score. You need to write a program to update the Hi
score whenever the game() function breaks the Hi-score.
# Step 1: Ask the user to enter their score
score = int(input("Enter your score: "))

# Step 2: Try to read the old high score from the file
try:
    with open("Hi-score.txt", "r") as file:
        old_score = file.read()
        if old_score.strip() == "":
            hi_score = 0
        else:
            hi_score = int(old_score)
except FileNotFoundError:
    # If file doesn't exist, set high score to 0
    hi_score = 0

# Step 3: Compare scores
if score > hi_score:
    print("New high score! ðŸŽ‰")
    # Step 4: Save the new high score into the file
    with open("Hi-score.txt", "w") as file:
        file.write(str(score))
else:
    print("Good try! The high score is still", hi_score)
