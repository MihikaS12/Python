#pg1:Write a program to find the greatest of four numbers entered by the user.
greatest= None
for i in range(4):
  num=int(input(f"Enter Number {i+1}: " ))
  if greatest is None or num>greatest:
    greatest=num
print("The Greatest Num is",greatest)

#pg2:Write a program to find out whether a student has passed or failed if it requires a 
total of 40% and at least 33% in each subject to pass. Assume 3 subjects and 
take marks as an input from the user.

sub1= float(input("enter marks of subject1: "))
sub2=float(input("enter marks of subject2: "))
sub3=float(input("Enter marks of subject3: "))
p1=(sub1/100)*100
p2=(sub2/100)*100
p3=(sub3/100)*100
total= sub1+sub2+sub3
percentage= total/300*100
if(p1>33 and p2>33 and p3>33 and percentage>=40):
  print("Pass")
else:
  print("Fail")
